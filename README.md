# About-the-Discovery-Lab.github
This page gives you an overview of the Discovery Lab - What is in the lab? what can you do? where can you go to learn more

The Discovery Lab is Virginia Tech’s newest experiential learning space for student-led collaborative research, prototyping, and experimentation - https://xl.vt.edu/discovery-lab.html. 
 
As a cornerstone for innovation on campus, the Discovery Lab is a one-of-a-kind environment outfitted with specialized instruments and equipment, where classroom knowledge meets hands-on exploration and industry-relevant skills. 

The Discovery Lab is a modern take on STEM-focused education, integrating traditional classroom activities with hands-on lab training, student-led experimentation, prototyping, and data analysis. Students will formulate and test hypotheses, use state-of-the-art instrumentation, develop data collection and analysis skills, and learn to pivot and try new ideas when they encounter roadblocks. With this foundation, undergrads will enter the workforce or graduate studies already tuned to be independent, resilient, and analytical thinkers — durable skills required for any successful career.

**Our Mission**
-Offer Structured onboarding and progressive credentialing pathways to deepen technical, quantiative, and professional skills for undergraduates, graduates, and faculty
-Forge partnerships with industry, enabling students to tackle real-world problems and gain career-ready skills.
-Foster cross-disciplinary engagement, sparking innovative solutions to complexc scientific and global societal challenges

**Our Space**
The Discovery Lab occupies 6,400 square feet on the first floor of the Undergraduate Science Laboratory Building.

**Key Instruments**
The Lab is equipped with full suite of scientific, analytical, and fabrication equipment that enable a wide scope of projects, from method development to device manufacture:
-Suite of sample processing tools
-Infrared/Raman microscopy
-Fluorescence/UV microscopy
-Gas and liquid chromatography 
-Mass spectrometry
-Laser diffraction particle size analysis
-Field deployable electrochemical detection platforms
-X-ray fluorescence spectrometry/elemental analysis
-Microfluidics
-Circuit board printer
-Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Mill
-Data analytics space

In addition to the equipment housed in its technical spaces, the Discover Lab is able to temporarily host loaned equipment required for class and research activities. 

**Who We Serve**
The Lab is available to any student at Virginia Tech who has completed the required safety and technical training. All instruments in the Lab are also accessible to students and faculty working in other areas of the Undergraduate Science Laboratory Building.

Faculty and departments can also request materials to support their classes and activities, integrate the Lab’s equipment into their coursework, and serve as mentors to student research teams.

Industry partners can engage with students, have a hand in guiding their professional development, and potentially recruit — while addressing issues of importance to their operations.
